Codsoft 
Iris Flower Classification Project
1. Introduction
The Iris Flower Classification project at Codsoft focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to classify Iris flowers into three distinct species—Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica—based on their sepal and petal measurements. The primary aim is to apply logistic regression, a fundamental yet powerful classification technique, to achieve accurate species classification.

2. Dataset Description
The dataset used comprises 150 Iris flower samples with the following features:

Sepal Length (cm)
Sepal Width (cm)
Petal Length (cm)
Petal Width (cm)
The target variable, species, includes:

0: Setosa
1: Versicolor
2: Virginica
3. Methodology

3.1. Data Loading: The Iris dataset is imported from scikit-learn and converted into a pandas DataFrame. Species are labeled with descriptive names for clarity.
3.2. Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 30% allocated for testing to ensure balanced evaluation.
3.3. Data Standardization: Features are standardized using scikit-learn's scaler to improve logistic regression performance by ensuring that features contribute equally.
3.4. Model Training: Logistic regression is employed to train the model on the standardized data, with 200 iterations to ensure convergence.
3.5. Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with a pair plot and correlation matrix to visualize feature relationships.
4. Results

4.1. Model Performance: High accuracy and detailed classification metrics indicate effective classification across all species.
4.2. Visualizations: The pair plot and correlation matrix provide insights into feature relationships and the model's ability to distinguish between species.
5. Conclusion
The project demonstrates the effective application of logistic regression in classifying Iris species. The high accuracy and informative visualizations support the model's robust performance and provide actionable insights into feature importance and species differentiation.

Titanic Survival Prediction Project
1. Introduction
The Titanic Survival Prediction project at Codsoft aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on features such as age, sex, and fare. Logistic regression is utilized to build a predictive model for binary classification.

2. Dataset Description
The Titanic dataset includes:

Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
Sex: Gender (male, female)
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Fare: Ticket fare
Embarked: Port of embarkation (Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton)
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
3. Methodology

3.1. Data Loading: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and converted into a pandas DataFrame. Initial data exploration reveals the dataset's structure.
3.2. Data Preprocessing: Missing values are imputed, and categorical variables are encoded numerically.
3.3. Feature Selection and Target Definition: Features and target variable are defined for model training.
3.4. Data Splitting: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets with a 70-30 split.
3.5. Data Standardization: Features are standardized to improve logistic regression performance.
3.6. Model Training: A logistic regression model is trained with 200 iterations to ensure convergence.
3.7. Model Evaluation: Performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix visualizations.
4. Results

4.1. Model Performance: The model achieves high accuracy with detailed metrics showing good performance across classes.
4.2. Visualization: The confusion matrix visualization provides insights into classification accuracy and errors.
5. Conclusion
The project effectively demonstrates logistic regression for predicting Titanic survival. The high accuracy and detailed evaluation metrics affirm the model's efficacy, with visualizations offering further insights into classification performance and potential areas for improvement.

Sales Prediction Project
1. Introduction
The Sales Prediction project at Codsoft focuses on predicting sales based on advertising expenditures across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels. Linear regression is employed to create a predictive model that helps optimize advertising strategies.

2. Dataset Description
The dataset contains:

TV: Advertising expenditure on TV (in thousands of dollars)
Radio: Advertising expenditure on Radio (in thousands of dollars)
Newspaper: Advertising expenditure on Newspaper (in thousands of dollars)
Sales: Sales figures (in thousands of units)
3. Methodology

3.1. Data Loading and Preparation: The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and prepared for analysis. Features include TV, Radio, and Newspaper expenditures, while Sales is the target variable.
3.2. Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets with 20% reserved for testing.
3.3. Model Selection and Training: A linear regression model is trained to learn the relationship between advertising expenditures and sales.
3.4. Model Evaluation: Performance is assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics.
3.5. Visualization: Scatter plots of actual vs. predicted sales and residuals distribution plots are created to evaluate prediction accuracy and residual patterns.
4. Results

4.1. Model Performance: The linear regression model demonstrates strong performance, with low MSE and high R², indicating effective prediction of sales.
4.2. Predictions: The model provides accurate sales predictions based on advertising expenditures, assisting businesses in optimizing their advertising strategies.
5. Conclusion
The project successfully applies linear regression to predict sales based on advertising expenditures. The model's performance metrics and visualizations validate its effectiveness, offering valuable insights for optimizing advertising budgets and maximizing sales.
